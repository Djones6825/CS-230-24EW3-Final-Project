Git hub read me - Daniel Jones

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
My Client was The Gaming Room and they wanted me to design a game called Draw It or Lose It.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel like I was able to accurately give the client all necessary information to make an education decision in which way they should take their program when regarding the choice of operating system, server and scalability. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a format ready to go really helped me by having a focus point. It allowed me to not worry about the scale of the project and instead helped me have a clear picture of the project and an outline.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the design constraints really has room for improvement. I’d like to know what the client’s major concerns like time, energy, and money is as well as what they have / haven’t worked with before.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Since this was presented as one company I thought of it as more of a starting business rather than a large corporation with a surplus of resources and gave them as much information as possible as well as realistic points of concern.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it by reviewing those that came before. Seeing if there were any similar apps or open sourced projects and seeing what hurdles they had to overcome and what they would change and their pain points. I really enjoyed this approach as it allowed me to envision the project as a whole and let me know the bounds or what I should and shouldn’t do.
